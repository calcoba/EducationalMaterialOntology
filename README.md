# EducationalMaterialOntology
The main task of this work has been to create knowledge graph in the field of educational
materials that can serve not only to enumerate their characteristics in a
structured way – in where tabular formats are sufficient – but also to relate them
with other relevant entities in the educational field. More concretely, our double
objective has been, on one side, to model the way educational materials can operate
as vehicles for students educational development and, on the other one, to relate
them with their creators – such as professors, publishers, etc.

There are also provided 5 n-arry pattern related to topics in literature, education and
